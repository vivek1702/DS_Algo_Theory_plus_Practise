# 1. Write a Python program to create a lambda function that adds 15 to a given number passed in as an argument, 
# also create a lambda function that multiplies argument x with argument y and prints the result.
# Sample Output:
# 25

#added single number
given_num = lambda x: x+15
print(given_num(15))


#multiple two given number
multiply_num = lambda x, y: x*y
print(multiply_num(12, 13))
